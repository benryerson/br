        <p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Bender, we're trying our best. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
        <h2>The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz</h2>
        <p>Your best is an idiot! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>

        <p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that's it. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go&hellip; look for more stuff to steal! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</p>

        <p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
