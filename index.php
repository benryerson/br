            <p>Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! Ahoy hoy? We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>

            <p>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Ahoy hoy?</p>

            <p>I'll keep it short and sweet &mdash; Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!</p>
            <h4>Last Exit to Springfield</h4>
            <p>&hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! D'oh. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he's holding a gun.</p>
