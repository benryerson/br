		<p><strong>I love design. Love. It.</strong></p>
		<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.branding10000lakes.com/">this amazing project</a> by the designer Nicole Meyer, I started designing logos for the various named mountains of Georgia.</p>
		<p>I have a few reasons for choosing this theme.</p>
		<ol class="rectangle-list">
			<li>Most mountains in Georgia don't seem to have logos because why would they? They're mountains.</li>
			<li>Many of their names have similar characteristics (Knob, Bald), making differentiation a challenge</li>
			<li>The list is not super-long so I'm hoping I can finish it maybe</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_in_Georgia_%28U.S._state%29">the list</a> I'm using as reference. Honestly, I don't know how accurate a list it is but I'm putting my trust in the Wikipedia community. My goal is to add a new logo when I'm able until I've covered the whole list.</p>
