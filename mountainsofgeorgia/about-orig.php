		<h2>I like designing logos...</h2>
		<span>(or why I decided it was time to practice more and, hopefully, suck less)</span>
		<p>My name is Ben Ryerson and I love design. Love it. And I try every day to be a better designer. So, inspired by <a href="http://www.branding10000lakes.com/">this amazing project</a> by the designer Nicole Meyer, I started designing logos for the various mountains of Georgia.</p>
		<p>I have a few reasons for choosing this theme.</p>
		<ol class="rectangle-list">
			<li>Most mountains in Georgia don't seem to have logos</li>
			<li>Many of their names have similar characteristics (Knob, Bald), making differentiation a challenge</li>
			<li>The list is not super-long so I'm hoping I can finish it maybe</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_in_Georgia_%28U.S._state%29">the list</a> I'm using as reference. Honestly, I don't know how accurate a list it is but I'm putting my trust in the Wikipedia community. I am not producing these in any particular order and my goal is to add a new logo each week until I've covered the whole list.</p>
		<p>Thanks for stopping by and I hope you see something you like!</p>
